The two documents used for creating alignments are called align and combine. They are both python programs.

The aligner works by running IBM 1 for a specified number of iterations. The output of that is passed to
a simplified HMM model, which estimates Viterbi alignments and optimizes parameters along those alignments.
Only alignment parameters are re-estimated; translation probabilities are left unchanged from the IBM 1 step.

To use them together, run something like the following example:

./align -i 5 -k 3 > fe_alignment
./align -i 5 -k 3 -f e -e f > ef_alignment
./combine -f fe_alignment -e ef_alignment > final_alignment

The most important flags for align are:
-i : number of iterations for which to run IBM 1
-k : number of iterations for which to run HMM
-n : number of sentences to process

The most important flags for combine are:
-f : file with the f2e alignments
-e : file with the e2f alignments
-t : type of alignment. This is one of:
	- reverse (invert the e2f alignments and print those)
	- intersect 
	- union
	- grow_diag (no final step)
	- grow_diag_final
